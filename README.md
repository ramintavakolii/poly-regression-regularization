# Polynomial Regression with Regularization

This project implements polynomial regression with regularization using Python. The main focus is on generating synthetic polynomial data, fitting polynomial models with varying degrees and regularization parameters, and visualizing the results.

## Features

- Generate polynomial data with noise
- Fit polynomial regression models with and without regularization
- Visualize the fitting process and errors
- Split data into training and testing sets for evaluation

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ramintavakolii/poly-regression-regularization.git
    cd poly-regression-regularization
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script to generate data, fit models, and visualize the results:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. You can modify the parameters in `main.py` to change the polynomial degree, regularization coefficients, noise level, and data range.

## Project Structure

- **polyreg.py**: Contains the `PolyReg` class implementation for polynomial regression.
- **main.py**: Main script to generate data, fit models, and plot results.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Examples

### Generating and Plotting Data

The script generates polynomial data and fits polynomial regression models with and without regularization. Below are some example plots generated by the script:
